# This script attempts to process files in a directory, but it contains a subtle bug.
# The bug is related to how it handles file paths and globbing patterns.

# Assume a directory structure like this:
# mydir/
#   file1.txt
#   subdir/
#     file2.txt

# The script aims to process all .txt files within mydir/, including those in subdirectories.

find mydir/ -name "*.txt" -print0 | while IFS= read -r -d $'
0' file; do
  echo "Processing: $file"
  # Process the file here (e.g., cat $file)
done
