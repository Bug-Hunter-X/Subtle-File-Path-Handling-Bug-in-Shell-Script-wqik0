#!/bin/bash

# Corrected script to properly handle file paths and globbing.

# The primary issue in the original script is that the while loop might not handle spaces or special characters in file names correctly.
# Using 'find ... -print0' and `while IFS= read -r -d \\0` is crucial for robustness when dealing with filenames containing special characters

find mydir/ -name "*.txt" -print0 | while IFS= read -r -d $'
0' file; do
  echo "Processing: $file"
  #Safely process the file.  Always quote variables
  #Example using 'cat', but replace with your specific processing logic
  cat "$file"
done
